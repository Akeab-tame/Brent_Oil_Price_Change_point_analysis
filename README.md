# Time Series Change Point Analysis and Statistical Modeling

## Project Summary
This repository presents a detailed examination of Brent oil prices, focusing on how major political and economic events influence these prices. Leveraging advanced statistical and econometric modeling, the project identifies change points within time series data and links them to significant events. This analysis aims to offer valuable insights for investors, analysts, and policymakers to improve decision-making.

## Project Overview
Birhan Energies, a consultancy firm specializing in energy sector insights, leads this project to study the effects of major events—such as policy shifts, geopolitical conflicts, global economic sanctions, and OPEC policy adjustments—on Brent oil prices. The analysis detects change points in the price series and examines potential causes.

## Introduction
The oil market’s volatility, influenced by geopolitical and economic factors, complicates decision-making for investors, policymakers, and energy companies. Identifying change points in time series data reveals key shifts in oil prices, helping stakeholders with risk assessment and strategic planning.

## Objectives
- **Main Objective:** Assess the impact of major political and economic events on Brent oil prices.
- **Sub-Objectives:**
  1. Establish a workflow for analyzing data and understanding models.
  2. Generate statistically relevant insights aligned with the business goals.
  3. Apply advanced models to analyze Brent oil price trends.
  4. Investigate other variables potentially influencing oil prices.

## Learning Outcomes
### Skills
- Statistical Modelling
- Using PyMC3 - a Bayesian modelling package in Python
- Running and modifying moderately large Python packages

### Knowledge
- Probability distributions and choosing the relevant one for a given task
- Bayesian inference
- Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
- Model comparison
- Policy analysis

## Methodology and Steps
### Data Analysis Workflow definition:
- Lay out clear steps for analyzing Brent oil price data.
- Gain a deep understanding of how data is generated and structured.
- Comprehend model inputs, parameters, and expected outputs.
- State any assumptions and limitations.
- Identify the most effective formats and channels for communicating findings.

### Understanding the Model and Data:
- Review key literature to grasp the models and concepts involved.
- Explore suitable models, such as ARIMA or GARCH, for time series analysis.
- Understand how these models apply to analyzing price fluctuations and their predictive capabilities.
- Describe expected outcomes, limitations, and the processes that generate the data.

### Analyze Brent Oil Prices
- Build on the foundational understanding of time series analysis.
- Apply this knowledge to analyze historical Brent oil prices data.

### Utilize Additional Statistical and Econometric Models
- Explore advanced time series models like VAR, Markov-Switching ARIMA, and LSTM networks.
- Analyze potential factors influencing oil prices, including economic indicators, technological changes, and political/regulatory factors.

### Adapting the Model to a New Scenario
- Apply the analysis framework to different scenarios or related datasets.
- Extend the model to incorporate new variables or data sources.
- Validate the model’s performance in predicting future price movements and other outcomes.

## Suggested Approach
### Data Collection:
- Compile datasets covering economic indicators, technological changes, and political factors from reputable sources like the World Bank, IMF, IEA, and industry reports.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies appropriately.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Perform EDA to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
- Use visualizations to gain insights into the interactions between different variables and oil prices.

### Model Building:
- Develop multiple models to capture different aspects of the data using time series models, econometric models, and machine learning algorithms.

### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the models using performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
- Compare the models to identify the best-performing ones.
